# **EasySave™**

Have you ever dreamed about a CLI Save Tool, then try ****EasySave™**™**! The best tool ever to save everything you need to save!

**EasySave™**, a robust data backup tool, evolves through various versions, each introducing enhanced features and functionalities. In version 1.0, **EasySave™** boasts a user-friendly console interface, supporting operations in both English and French. However, the backup capabilities are limited to handling five tasks, and the software generates daily log files exclusively in JSON format. While it lacks the ability to pause tasks, it includes a status file for tracking progress and operates in a mono or sequential backup mode.

Version 1.1 builds upon the foundation of its predecessor by maintaining the console interface and multilingual support. Notably, the backup task limitation remains at five, but now users have the flexibility to choose between JSON and XML log file formats. Additionally, users gain the ability to pause individual or multiple tasks, enhancing control over the backup process.

With the release of version 2.0, **EasySave™** undergoes a significant transformation by adopting a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) graphical interface. This version breaks free from the previous task limitations, offering unlimited backup tasks. Furthermore, it expands log file options to include both JSON and XML formats. Users can now encrypt their data using an external encryption software called "CryptoSoft," adding an extra layer of security to their backups.

The pinnacle of **EasySave™**'s evolution is seen in version 3.0, where it continues to leverage the WPF interface while introducing parallel backup operations. This version empowers users to execute multiple backup tasks simultaneously, significantly improving efficiency. Notably, the software now features an intelligent halt mechanism, detecting the presence of essential business software and preventing the initiation of new tasks. It goes a step further by halting all ongoing transfers if the software detects a potential conflict.

Version 3.0 also introduces the concept of file priority management, allowing users to designate certain files as high priority, ensuring their prompt backup even in the presence of other ongoing tasks. Moreover, it addresses the challenge of handling large files by prohibiting simultaneous backups, ensuring optimal resource utilization. **EasySave™**'s commitment to user convenience is evident with the addition of a remote visualization interface, enabling users to monitor and manage their backups remotely. Additionally, it maintains compatibility with command-line operations, ensuring flexibility for users who prefer a text-based interface.

The mono-instance feature in version 3.0 stands out, allowing users to run only one instance of the application. This prevents potential conflicts and enhances the overall stability of the backup process. With these advancements, **EasySave™** establishes itself as a versatile and user-centric backup solution, catering to the evolving needs of its users across different versions.
